# Java Learning Streaks

## Overview
"Java Learning Streaks" is a personal project documenting my journey of learning Java. It includes a series of exercises, projects, and detailed explanations of various concepts. The goal is to build a comprehensive understanding of Java programming, from basic syntax to advanced topics.

## Motivation
This project serves as a portfolio of my learning progress and a resource for others interested in Java. By documenting each step, I aim to solidify my understanding and contribute to the learning community.

## Project Structure
-.class: Contains the actual code's class file.
-.java:Contains the actual code.
-docs: Includes detailed notes and explanations of concepts, algorithms, and data structures.
examples: Houses sample code and mini-projects that illustrate practical applications of concepts.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and set up your development environment:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Rohith055/Java-Learning-Streaks.git
cd Java-Learning-Streaks
